Here is a list of the design patterns used in this project:

Observer:

    For our GUI we use the observer design pattern create a cause and effect relationship between sub-scenes and
    super-scenes. In our program, there are three types of scenes that use inheritance:
        - UserDashboardController (UDC) has children AdminDashboardController, AttendeeDashboardController, etc.
        - DisplayEventsController (DEC) has children DisplayDeletableEvents, DisplayAvailableEvents, etc.
        - EventInfoController (EIC) has children EventInfoDeleteController, EventInfoSignUpController, etc.

    These three classes are what we consider "SceneParents", which is why they are in the folder with that name.
    EventInfoController extends Observable, DisplayEventsController extends Observable and implements Observer, and
    UserDashboardController implements Observer.
    There is at least 1 child for each of the SceneParents for each of the UserGUIs, so it would be difficult to
    explain every single observer relationship, so I will explain two specific cases:

        In the AdminGUI, the AdminDashboard is loaded. Upon initialization, it loads a sub-scene that is associated
        with DisplayDeletableEvents. While the scene loads, the dashboard begins observing DisplayDeletableEvents.
        Within the sub-scene, if the user clicks on an event, the program loads another sub-scene but this one is
        associated with EventInfoDeleteController. At the same time, the DisplayDeletableEvents controller begins
        observing the EventInfoDeleteController. Then if the user chooses to delete an event in this final sub-scene,
        it notifies the DisplayDeletableEvents controller, which updates by notifying the AdminDashboard to re-load
        the DisplayDeletableEventsController. So it is a chain of two observer relationships.
            - Cause: Admin deletes an event.
            - Effect: the events list being shown gets updated to remove that event.

        The same thing occurs when an Organizer chooses to modify an event, but there are some subtle differences.
        In this case we have OrganizerDashboard observing DisplayModifiableEvents observing EventInfoModify.
        Within the final sub-scene, the user can choose between "remove event", "modify speaker", or "edit event".
        Depending on the choice, the EventInfoModifyController while notify its observers and pass a string argument
        that will determine which scene the dashboard will load next. So it's the same premise but more versatile.

Singleton?

Dependency Injection?
